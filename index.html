      <p>
        This is a note after the arguments and problems we have been having. Look I don't like them, I don't wanna be mean to you and I def don't wanna hurt you. I want you to understand that I'll do anything for you — but do you have the same for me? If you do, I need you to make me feel wanted, cuz when you don't, I lose my desire to be in this relationship, which I don't want.
        <br><br>
        You have made tons of mistakes and I am willing to overlook them all, just don't make me regret this. I love you baby, please let me love you forever, please keep being my sweet sweet girl.
